Product Recommendation System
Overview
This project implements a product recommendation system using NLP embeddings and cosine similarity to find and suggest similar products. It features a Streamlit web interface for user interaction, SQL database for product storage, and machine learning algorithms for recommendation generation.
Tech Stack

Web Interface: Streamlit
Machine Learning: Cosine Similarity
NLP: Text embeddings for product description analysis
Database: SQL

Features

Product search and browsing
Similarity-based recommendations
User-friendly interface
Efficient product information retrieval

Project Workflow

Data Collection & Storage:

Import product data into SQL database
Store product details including descriptions, categories, prices, etc.


Text Processing:

Preprocess product descriptions
Generate text embeddings using NLP techniques


Similarity Calculation:

Compute cosine similarity between product embeddings
Rank products based on similarity scores


Web Interface:

Display product information
Show recommendations based on selected products
Allow filtering and sorting options



Installation
bash# Clone the repository
