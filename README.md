# 🛍️ Intelligent Product Recommender System

## 📌 Project Overview

The **Intelligent Product Recommender System** analyzes product descriptions using **NLP embeddings** and compares them using **Cosine Similarity** to suggest semantically similar items.

It uses:

- 🧠 **NLP-based Embeddings** – to understand descriptions beyond simple keyword matching  
- 🧮 **Cosine Similarity** – to compute similarity between products  
- 🗄️ **SQL** – to store and fetch product data  
- 🖼️ **Streamlit** – to display everything in a sleek, interactive UI
